Meowst is a **(MASSIVE WORK IN PROGRESS)** sandbox/rpg/survival game with minimal mechanics. 
Beyond the tutorial, the game should go on for infinitely until you decide to either stop playing or make a new save file

Name your character, and be on your way to becoming the strongest... meowster... in the world!

To install the game, just download the .zip file (big green button on GitHub) and extract it wherever you want.

This is my very first attempt at game dev, go easy on me!
