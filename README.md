Meowst is a turn-based combat game with minimal mechanics. 
Beyond the tutorial, the game goes on infinitely until you decide to either stop playing or make a new save file
(You can totally edit the save file super easily with a text editor if you feel like cheating).

Name your character and enemy, and be on your way to becoming the strongest... meowster... in the world!

To install the game, just download the .zip file (big green button on GitHub) and extract it wherever you want.
Currently, the only way to play this game is to open the src folder in the command line and enter "java Main.java"
Until there's a real graphics engine behind this project, this is how the game will be played.

This is my very first attempt at game dev, go easy on me!
