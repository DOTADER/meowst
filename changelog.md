**Fixes**
-
- None because this is the first working*ish* build LOL

***

**Improvements**
-
- 2D graphics capabilities!!! LWJGL with LibGDX is a huge carry here! (do we call this "Phase 2(D)?")
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is finally, *actually,* a vital part of the game
- New changelog file! :D

***

**Features**
-
- So. Many. ANIMALS.
- Block variety (yet to be implemented, but it's in the classes)
- Items, weapons, armor, and upgradable materials that give different perks and debuffs

***

**Known Bugs**
-
- Pretty much nothing works except the player and its controller, enjoy the demo! :D

***

**Plans**
-
- Squash the bugs, create 1,025 more bugs, etc. etc. until the thing works.
- Procedurally generated terrain for Overworld, Cave, and Underwater areas.
- "Homebase" for the player, equipped with an upgradable shop
- Day/Night Cycle
- Rare solar eclipse event (~1/500 chance?) with unique enemies and affects on the world
- MANY Enemies and Passive animals unique to their environments
- Inventory system (*again, yay.*)
- So much more, I post random ideas on Mastodon @DOTADER@theres.life
